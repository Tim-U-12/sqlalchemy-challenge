This repository contains the following:
* jupyter notebook : "climate_starter"
* python script : "app.py"
<br><br>
jupyter notebook : "climate_starter" <br>
This notebook contains a analysis on the weather in Hawaii. It uses SQLAlchemy to connect to a local db and from there performs analysis on the prepitation and temperature.
<br><br>
python script : "app.py" <br>
This creates a local api that performs similar queries to that of the jupyter notebook
